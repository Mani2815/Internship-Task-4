# Tableau KPI Dashboard Analysis

## Objective
The goal of this project is to create an interactive KPI dashboard in Tableau to analyze the following metrics:
- Total Sales
- Total Profit
- Profit Margin
- Monthly/Yearly Sales Trends
- Sales by Region/Category

## Dataset
The dataset includes key business data such as:
- Sales Amount
- Profit
- Region
- Category
- Time-series data

The data is sourced from kaggle.

## Methodology
1. **Load Data into Tableau**: Imported the dataset into Tableau Desktop for visualization.
2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Checked for missing or inconsistent data.
   - Created calculated fields like `Profit Margin`.
3. **Visualization Creation**:
   - Built visualizations for each KPI using appropriate chart types (e.g., bar charts, line charts, heatmaps).
4. **Dashboard Assembly**:
   - Combined all visualizations into a single, interactive dashboard with filters and tooltips for better insights.
5. **Insights**:
   - Analyzed trends, performance metrics, and regional/category-based performance.

## Key Visualizations
- **Total Sales & Profit**: Represented with bar charts for clear comparison.
- **Profit Margin**: Displayed as percentages to understand profitability trends.
- **Sales Trends**: Time-series charts showing monthly/yearly sales progression.
- **Sales by Region/Category**: Highlighted top-performing categories and regions.

## Tools Used
- Tableau Desktop
- Spreadsheet editor for initial data cleaning (if needed).

## Insights
- High sales but low profit in specific regions.
- Seasonal spikes in sales during particular months.
- Categories driving most profit margins.

## Recommendations
- Focus marketing efforts on high-performing regions and categories.
- Analyze low-profit regions for potential cost-cutting or strategic changes.

## Conclusion
This Tableau dashboard provides valuable insights into business performance, aiding strategic decision-making with data-driven approaches.
